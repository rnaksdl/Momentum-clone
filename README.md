I'm going to learn to make web-apps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have so many ideas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Java Script is the programming language to learn if you wanna do web stuff.
So I decided to learn some JS, CSS, HTML first.
Then I'll move on to React and Firebase.

1. What do js, css, html do?
	- js is for interacttion
	- css is for styling
	- html is the program that runs.
		- You need to link CSS and script JS in HTML!
